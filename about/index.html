    <h1 class="title"> About </h1>
    <div class="content"> <h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Edis Rahic, an aspiring software developer with a growing portfolio of projects built using modern web technologies such as Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into user-friendly applications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-was-i-doing-before-software-development">What was I doing before software development?</h2>
<p>Before transitioning into tech, I worked in the criminal justice system, supporting clients through the court system and helping them complete court-ordered sanctions. These experiences strengthened my ability to analyze information, handle sensitive data responsibly, and communicate clearly; skills that carry over into writing clean, maintainable code and collaborating effectively on software projects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-did-i-become-interested-in-software-development">How did I become interested in software development?</h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, as my contract with the John Howard Society of Toronto was coming to an end, I began exploring new career paths. I became curious about coding after learning how people could build applications used by thousands or even millions worldwide. Encouraged by a close friend, I decided to dive into software development, and I’ve been hooked ever since.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-have-i-done-so-far">What have I done so far?</h2>
<p>I started with Codecademy’s Python and Data Analysis courses, which gave me my first experience writing code. To strengthen my skills further, I completed the Computing in Python program from Georgia Tech, where I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving.</p>
<p>From there, I expanded into web development through The Odin Project, where I built projects such as a Next.js calculator app and am continuing to explore JavaScript, React, and modern web frameworks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on-now">What am I working on now?</h2>
<p>I’m currently building new projects through The Odin Project while also creating independent applications like a Next.js calculator. My goal is to deepen my frontend development skills while also branching into areas such as Ruby and backend development.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="outside-of-coding">Outside of coding</h2>
<p>When I’m not coding, I focus on staying active and mentally sharp. I enjoy long-distance cycling (typically 25–30 km rides, with a personal best of 40.5 km), reading classics like Brave New World and Moby Dick, and exploring immersive PC games such as Fallout: New Vegas, which inspire me with their storytelling and complex decision-making systems.</p>
