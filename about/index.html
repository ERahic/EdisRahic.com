    <h1 class="title"> About </h1>
    <div class="content"> <h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Edis Rahic. I am an aspiring software developer with a growing portfolio of projects built using modern web technologies, including Next.js, React, and TypeScript.</p>
<p>I also bring experience from the criminal justice system, where I have supported clients through the court system and coordinated community programs.</p>
<p>I enjoy solving problems, whether it’s creating efficient software solutions or improving workflows in community services.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-was-i-doing-before-software-development">What was I doing before software development?</h2>
<p>Alongside my current focus on software development, I remain intensely interested in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>My experience supporting clients through the court system and helping them complete court-ordered sanctions has provided me with valuable skills in analyzing information, handling sensitive data responsibly, and communicating clearly.</p>
<p>These skills are now applied both in casework and software development projects that aim to support communities.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-did-i-become-interested-in-software-development">How did I become interested in software development?</h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, as my contract with the John Howard Society of Toronto was nearing its end, I explored new ways to make an impact.</p>
<p>I became curious about coding after seeing how software could be used to solve problems for large groups of people and support community services.</p>
<p>Encouraged by a close friend, I decided to dive into software development, and I’ve been hooked ever since; always thinking about how technology can complement my ongoing interest in social programs and justice-related work.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-have-i-done-so-far">What have I done so far?</h2>
<p>I started with Codecademy’s Python and Data Analysis courses, which gave me my first experience writing code. To further strengthen my skills, I completed the Computing in Python program at Georgia Tech, where I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.</p>
<p>From there, I expanded into web development through The Odin Project, where I built projects such as a Next.js calculator app and am continuing to explore JavaScript, React, and modern web frameworks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on-now">What am I working on now?</h2>
<p>I’m currently building new projects through The Odin Project while also creating independent applications, such as a Next.js calculator.</p>
<p>My goal is to deepen my frontend development skills while also branching into areas such as Ruby and backend development.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="outside-of-coding">Outside of coding</h2>
<p>When I’m not coding, I focus on staying active and mentally sharp. I enjoy long-distance cycling (typically 25–30 km rides, with a personal best of 40.5 km), reading classics like Brave New World and Moby-Dick, and exploring immersive PC games, such as Fallout: New Vegas, which inspire me with their storytelling and complex decision-making systems.</p>
<p>I also continue to follow developments in community services and the justice system, combining my interests in technology and social impact.</p>
